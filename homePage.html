    <h1>Room Reservation Redesign</h1>
    <h2>Team member: Aderonke Adelegan, Josh Samuel, Selassie Susuawu</h2>
    <h2>Stakeholders: RIT, RIT Students, Clubs/Organizations</h2>
<p>
The direction to reduce the 
difficulty and confusion that students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services is 
to redesign the interface. For example, when navigating the homepage, the first location to create a reservation is in 
the menu side bar, but for users who are focused on the center of the screen, this may be difficult to find. 
The current interface causes students to abandon the page after facing confusion on how to select a room, and 
this can gravely affect a student's education and experience with RIT. We plan to redesign the interface and 
provide something that stays true to the task of selecting a room to reserve without the current confusion. 
The location of "Create a Reservation" button will be moved from the bottom of the page, to allow users to find it quicker, 
and complete their task more efficiently. Along with other redesigns as that for schedule page that shows what rooms are currently 
available for the time slots. We will do this by using software such as Figma to bring our idea to life. Our plan is to create an 
interface that is intuitive, and user friendly, which will positively affect students' educational experience. Below is a link to 
details of this project and redesign.
