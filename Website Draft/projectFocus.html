**Problem Statement**

<p> Our goal is to simplify the reservation process of a study room at the RIT Library Services.</p>

<p> The current interface proves to be difficult and confusing when selecting a room to study in. </p>

<p> Our motivation behind this is that as students of Interaction and design we owe it a responsibility to simplify and 
make simple user interafces that are </p>
<p> cumbersome and hence makes student shy away from using the system </p>

<p> From the begining at the hompage, to the screen where users view what is available, 
users face diffculty navigating and locating how to book a room. 

<p> Many students have attempted to book a study room with the current interface and encountered challenges including: 
	<p> 1. Difficulty in booking snd reservation due to complex systems</p>
	<p> 2. Location of input buttons</p>
	<p> 3. View of Schedules 
	<p> 4. Selection of schedules </p>

<p> These Challenges encountered during the booking and reservation have left students frustrated with the process and made, 
them to abandon the use of study rooms made specially for providing condusive environment for self-study.Hence students 
therefore do not have a quiet and isolated space to study </p>

<p> A well-designed reservation portal will significantly improve efficiency, usability, and user satisfaction in educational settings" (Sayson et.al.2025). </p>

<p> We believe students should be able to find and book a study with ease, to enable them to focus on study in a peace and quite room and pass their respective programs</p>

**Solution:** 

<p> Our solution to mitigate this difficulty and confusion that students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services is to:</p> 
<p> 1. Redesign the current interface </p>
<p> 	 -Simplify the navivation process to reserve a study room </p>
<p> 	 -Position the reservation buttons in the center of the page for easy visibility and accesibility</p>
<P> 	 -Arrange the buttons and the fields on the page well</p>
<p> 	 -Homepage Navigation </p>
  
<p> With the option to reserve a room, One has to scroll all the way down on the homepage before finding an orange button that says 
		<p> "Create a Reservation" </p>
<p> We agree the color of the input button stands out against the white screen but the location is inconvinent to user
and not easy to find. 
<Once a user clicks on this button they are navigated to a selection of vacant rooms or spaces that are available for reservation. 
<p> One being a study room. Though the text says "Reserve a Study Room" users are unable to click on the text itself to complete this action. 
<p> On the booking page also, the menu is on the left and users have to scroll to select parameters such as date, time, 
number of people, and room. </p>
<p> We believe having the navigation bar horizontal to the center of the screen will be much more visible to users to navigate. 

<p> Another design flaw we noticed is once a user selects a time slot and hit search, the arrangement showing what is available is very 
confusing to read and understand. <p/>
<p> The current look shows all available rooms and times booked. Even if they are not available for students to select, 
 which is confusing for users deciding what is available to them. 
<p> This is a problem we are going to solve by implementing a system that is easy to understand. 
<p> The current interface causes students to abandon the page after facing difficulties and frustration on how to select a room, and this can gravely affect a student's education and experience with RIT. 

<p> Our plan is to create an interface that is: </p>
<p> 1. Intuitive </p>
<p> 2. User freindly, which will enhance students' user experience with study room reservation. </p>
