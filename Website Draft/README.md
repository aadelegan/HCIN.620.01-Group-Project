# Room Reservation Redesign
**Team Members:** Aderonke Adelegan, Josh Samuel, Selassie Susuawu


**Stakeholders: RIT, RIT Students, Clubs/Organizations** 

The current problem with reserving a study room in RIT Library Services website is that the interface proves to be difficult and confusing when reserving a room to study in. The students who have had to use this site have been extremely confused at different points of the process. 


The direction to reduce the difficulty and confusion that students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services is to redesign the interface. For example, when navigating the homepage, the first location to create a reservation is in the menu side bar, but for users who are focused on the center of the screen, this may be difficult to find. The current interface causes students to abandon the page after facing confusion on how to select a room, and this can gravely affect a student's education and experience with RIT. We plan to redesign the interface and provide something that stays true to the task of selecting a room to reserve without the current confusion. The location of "Create a Reservation" button will be moved from the bottom of the page, to allow users to find it quicker, and complete their task more efficiently. Along with other redesigns as that for schedule page that shows what rooms are currently available for the time slots. We will do this by using software such as Figma to bring our idea to life. Our plan is to create an interface that is intuitive, and user friendly, which will positively affect students' educational experience. Below is a link to details of this project and redesign.
