Our goal is to solve the current problem students face with reserving a study room with the RIT Library Servicces. The current interface proves to be difficult and confusing when selecting a room to study in. One of the first issues we noticed is the locaton of the **"Create a Reservation"** button. Our motivation behind this is that as students we have had to se this site and have been left very confused at different points of the process. From the begining at the hompage, to the screen where users view what is available, users face diffculty nagivatig and locating how to book a room, the view of the page is not easy to read or understant. Our team members have attempted to book a study room with the current interface and encountered challenges including navigation, location of buttons, view of schedule, selection of schedule, and more. These problems left many of our team members frustrated with the process, causing individuals to abandon the page all togther and therefore not have a quiet and isolated space to study. We believe students should be able to find and book a study with ease, allowing them to focus on studying and bettering their grades.

**Solution:** Our solution is to mitigate the difficulty and confusion students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services, by redesigning the current interface. When navigating the homepage, the first location to screate a reservation is in the menu side bar, but for users who are focused on the center of the screen, this may be difficult to find. The second option to reserving a room is to scroll all the way down on the homepage before finding an orange button that says "Create a Reservation". We agree the color of the button stands out against the white screen but the location is inconvinent and not easy to find. Once users click on this button they are navigated to a selection of spaces that can be reserved, one being a study room. Though the text says "Reserve a Study Room" users are unable to click on the text itself to complete this action. Once users are on the bokking page, again the menu is on the left and users have to scroll to select parameters such as date, time, number of people, and room. We believe having the navigation bar horizontal to the center of the screen is easer to see and navigate. Another design flaw we noticed is once user selects a time slot and hit search, the arrangement showing what is available is very confusing to read and understand. The current look shows all available rooms and times even if they are not available for students to select, which is confusing for users deciding what is available to them. Students might also abandon the page after notunderstanding how to select a room, and this can gravely affect a student's education and experience with RIT
