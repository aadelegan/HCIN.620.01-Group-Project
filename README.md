Our goal is to solve the current problem students face with reserving a room with the RIT Library Servicces. The current interface proves to be difficult and confusing when selecting a room to study in. One of the first issues we noticed is the locaton of the **"Create a Reservation"** button. When navigating the homepage, the first location to screate a reservation is in the menu side bar, but for users who are focused on the center of the screen, this may be difficult to find. The second option to reserving a room is to scroll all the way down on the homepage before finding 


**Solution:** Our solution is to mitigate the difficulty and confusion students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services, by redesigning the current interface.
