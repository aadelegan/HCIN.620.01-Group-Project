					<h1>RIT Library Services Interface Redesign
						<br>Problem Statement</h1>
					<p>
Our goal is to solve the current problem students face with reserving a study room with the RIT Library Services. The current interface proves to be difficult and confusing when selecting a room to study in. Our motivation behind this is that as students we have had to see this site and have been left very confused at different points of the process. From the beginning at the homepage, to the screen where users view what is available, users face difficulty navigating and locating how to book a room. Our team members have attempted to book a study room with the current interface and encountered challenges including navigation, location of buttons, view of schedule, selection of schedule, and more. These problems left many of our team members frustrated with the process, causing individuals to abandon the page all together and therefore not have a quiet and isolated space to study; "well-designed reservation portals significantly improve efficiency, usability, and user satisfaction in educational settings" <b> (Sayson et.al.2025)</b>. We believe students should be able to find and book a study with ease, allowing them to focus on studying and bettering their grades.

					<h2>Our Solution to the Problem</h2>
					<p> The direction to reduce the difficulty and confusion that students currently face while booking a room with RIT Library services is to redesign the interface. For example, when navigating the homepage, the first location to create a reservation is in the menu side bar, but for users who are focused on the center of the screen, this may be difficult to find. The current interface causes students to abandon the page after facing confusion on how to select a room, and this can gravely affect a student's education and experience with RIT. We plan to redesign the interface and provide something that stays true to the task of selecting a room to reserve without the current confusion. The location of "Create a Reservation" button will be moved from the bottom of the page, to allow users to find it quicker, and complete their task more efficiently. Along with other redesigns such as the schedule page that shows what rooms are currently available for the time slots. Our plan is to create an interface that is intuitive, and user friendly, which will positively affect students' educational experience. Below is a link to details of this project and redesign.
